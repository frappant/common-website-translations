# Common website translations

## Description
Anyone who ever works on a website in multiple languages knows that at some point, there is a painful 
process during which a load of strings need to be translated. Without employing translators for various 
languages, who have a detailed insight into the project, it's often a drawn-out process to get content and 
technical translations into the system.

At [!frappant](https://frappant.ch/), we are continually working on websites in multiple languages. A common 
task in Switzerland, which has four official national languages, as well as a common use of English. So we're 
often making extensions for [TYPO3](https://frappant.ch/was/#cms) and plugins or themes for [WordPress](https://frappant.ch/was/#cms) which need to be translated.

We came to the conclusion that many terms and sentences which our code puts on the website are repeated over 
and over again. So there's little point in having them re-translated all the time. Instead, we're going to maintain 
a list of non-client-specific translations in this repository. In most cases, the translations will be copied 
into a specific plugin or extension, so we have the opportunity to tweak the text according to client needs as 
necessary. In many cases, we'll save our clients at least some of the pain - and perhaps cost - of dealing 
with technical translation files.

## Contribute
If you feel like contributing to this public resource, then please feel free to fork this repository, make amendments 
or additions, and submit them using a pull request. **Please don't add automatically-generated translations** from Google 
Translate etc.!!! This list should remain a confirmed, accurate public resource.

Please make sure that any changes to the CSV file are UTF-8 encoded, so that special characters don't break.

If any of the translations awaken interest in what technology they're used for, then don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:support@frappant.ch). 
We speak English, German, Swiss German and French.
